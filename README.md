beautified-JOSM-preset
======================

Replace the, admittedly rather ugly, standard icons in the default JOSM preset with such from http://www.sjjb.co.uk/mapicons/introduction ,  http://osm-icons.org and a handful of very ugly ones from myself . This effort is mainly for use with Vespucci and for now uses 48x48 pixel icons with inverted colors.  

The original icons remain if they currently don't have a replacement, current count is 54 original icons left. A roughly 100 further presets not present in the JOSM file have be added to cover craft and office tags. 

The scripts

 * vespucci.sh will produce a version (vespucci_preset.xml) of the file suitable for inclusion in a build
 * download.sh wil produce a version with URLs to this site for downloading

Something similar  could be done directly with the SVG versions of the icons for inclusion in JOSM.
