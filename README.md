beautified-JOSM-preset
======================

WIP

Replace the, admittedly rather ugly, standard icons in the default JOSM preset with such from http://www.sjjb.co.uk/mapicons/introduction and potentially http://osm-icons.org . This effort is mainly for use with Vespucci and for now uses 32x32 pixel icons with inverted colors.  

The original icons remain if they currently don't have a replacement.
